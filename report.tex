\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this course is to understand how the Theory of Algorithms coincide with the application of functions and algorithms in Software Engineering. In particular, this course places an emphasis on the concepts of Automata, Logic, and Concurrency in regard to algorithms in our eventual application of these topics to a final project.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
\subsection{Week 1} During this week, the overall outline and "roadmap" of topics and project deadlines were covered during class, as well as an introduction to the concept of Definitive Finite Automata (DFA).
\subsection{Week 2} Lectures covered Definitive Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-Definitive Finite Automata (NFA) in more detail, as well as how to convert NFA to DFA.
\subsection{Week 3}
\section{Homework}\label{homework}

This section contains solutions to homework. 

\subsection{Week 3}
The objective of this week's homework is to convert a given NFA to a DFA by hand.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

(approx 400 words) A critical reflection on the content of the course. Step back from the technical details. How does the course fit into the wider world of software engineering? What did you find most interesting or useful? What improvements would you suggest?
